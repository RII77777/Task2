        Bill Gates (born October 28, 1955) is an American businessman and philanthropist.
        A pioneer of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, he co-founded the software company Microsoft in 1975 with his childhood friend Paul Allen.
        Following the company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), Gates became a billionaire in 1987â€”then the youngest ever, at age 31.
